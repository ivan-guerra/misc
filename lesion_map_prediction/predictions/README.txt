The lesion map matrices in this directory were all targeting a behavioral
score of 50.0. You can recreate these matrices by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run: cd /path/to/lesion_map_prediction/src/
3. Run: python predict_lmap.py A 50.0

You can replace 'A' with the label of the layer you would like to make a
prediction on. See the project README for more details.
